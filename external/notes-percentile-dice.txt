the "00-0 method" and the "90-0 (or high/low) method". 
In both methods, you roll two ten-sided dice (d10s): one marked with multiples of ten (00, 10, 20, etc.) for the tens digit, and one marked 0-9 for the ones digit. 
1. The 00-0 method
This is the most common and official method described in the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook. 

		The 0-9 die is always read as a single digit.
		The "0" on the ones die is read as a 0, unless the tens die also shows "00."
		If you roll "00" on the tens die and "0" on the ones die, the result is read as 100.
		Any other combination of "00" on the tens die with a number on the ones die (e.g., 00 and 7) is read as that single-digit number (7). 

Examples:

		Roll: 70 and 1 = 71
		Roll: 00 and 5 = 5
		Roll: 00 and 0 = 100
		Roll: 10 and 0 = 10 

2. The 90-0 (or high/low) method
This older, less common method treats the ones die differently. 

		In this approach, the "0" on the ones die is always read as a 10.
		This removes the special "100" case, but makes some rolls read differently. For example, a 90 and a 0 are added together to make 100. 

Examples:

		Roll: 70 and 1 = 71
		Roll: 00 and 5 = 5
		Roll: 00 and 0 = 10
		Roll: 10 and 0 = 20 (10+10)
